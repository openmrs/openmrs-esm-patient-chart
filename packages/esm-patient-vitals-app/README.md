# esm-patient-vitals-app

The vitals widget. It provides tabular and chart-based overviews of the vitals recorded for a patient as well as a form for recording vitals and biometrics. It also provides a vitals header that displays a summary of the most recently recorded vitals.

## Development

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
yarn run --sources 'packages/esm-patient-vitals-app
```

This should fire up a development server on port --8081. You can use `--port` to specify an alternative port.
