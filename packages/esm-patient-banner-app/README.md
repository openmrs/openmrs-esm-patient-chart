# esm-patient-banner-app

The patient banner widget. It provides a banner that displays the patient's name, their avatar, gender, age and identifiers. It also provides an expandable panel that shows their address, contact details and relationships with other patients. The patient banner can also display custom tags to mark out whether a patient has an active visit ongoing or whether they are deceased.

## Development

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
yarn run --sources 'packages/esm-patient-banner-app
```

This should fire up a development server on port --8081. You can use `--port` to specify an alternative port.
