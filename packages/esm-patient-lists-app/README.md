# esm-patient-lists-app

The Patient Lists app renders a workspace in the Patient Chart that displays:

- A tabular overview of the Patient Lists available.
- A detail view that shows metadata about a selected list, including the patients enrolled to that list. Clicking on a patient enrolled in the list navigates you to their chart.

This is not a replacement for the Patient Lists Management app in the home page, but rather a pared down version that's only meant to exist in the Patient Chart.
