# esm-generic-patient-widgets-app

This is a proof-of-concept for a generic widget that can be added to the patient chart using configuration. It can be made to display any obs in either a tabular view or a chart view. It's intended as a pathway to creating reusable widgets across the application. 

## Development

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
yarn run --sources 'packages/esm-generic-patient-widgets-app'
```

This should fire up a development server on port `8081`. You can use `--port` to specify an alternative port.
