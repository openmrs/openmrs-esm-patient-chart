# esm-patient-biometrics-app

The biometrics widget. It provides tabular and chart-based overviews of the biometrics recorded for a patient as well as a form for recording vitals and biometrics.

## Development

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
yarn run --sources 'packages/esm-patient-biometrics-app'
```

This should fire up a development server on port `8081`. You can use `--port` to specify an alternative port.
